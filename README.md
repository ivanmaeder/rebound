# Rebound

A prototype interface [Sadhbh Doherty](http://rhymeswithfive.com/) and I came up with one day hanging out at [Opendesk](https://www.opendesk.cc/).

With the idea of making a piece of furniture warmer and more personal, we decided to give a table a way to communicate via taps and vibrations. In this prototype the table replies with the same pattern with which the user knocks.

USER: "Morning!" ***TAP, TAPATAP***

TABLE: ***TAP, TAPATAP*** [Good morning to you too!]

This code activates a solenoid with the same pattern received by the piezo, combining [this](https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/solenoid-control-with-arduino.html) and [this](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Knock) circuit.
